Python Django Code Sample

A REST API of sample todo list application. 
Create/Edit/Delete/Get/List task items. 
The code is a bit old, but still it demonstrated my following skills

* Using django rest framework
* Authentication with JWT and authorization permission logic
* Writing tests with pytest, test fixtures with factory_boy, mocking
* Serialization with python marshmallow
* Playing around with sphinx-doc for writing documentation, and apispec for REST Swagger docs
